         The earliest computer was probably better known as calculating machines and were basically mechanical devices and was operated by hand.
         Charles Babbage 's proposal the Difference Engine which was never completed, the construction of the Difference Engine which perform differential equations,
             which was inspired by Babbage's idea to apply the ability of machines to calculate mathematics. After on working on the Difference Engine for ten years Babbage's
         was inspired by another machine, he called it Analytical Engine. The invention was a major step towards the design of modern computer it was conceived general-purpose.
         The second major in the design of computing is in the 19 th century to the American Herman Hollerith he was finding a faster way to compute the U.S census.</p>

    <h2>Computer During War</h2>
 </header>
     <p>At the onset of the Second World War there was an increase for computer projects which technical progress to develop computer to exploit their potential importance.
         In 1941 the German engineer Konrad Zuse  developed a computer the Z3 to design airplanes and missiles, later the British completed a secret code-breaking computer
         to decode the German messages. Also the Electronic Numerical and computer (ENIAC) was produced by the partnership between the U.S and the University of Pennsylvania
         in 1943 and the computer is a massive machinery it consumed 160 kilowatts of electrical power, enough to dim the light to a section of a bigger town.

      <h2> Generations of Computer</h2>
  </header>
      <p>
          In 1948, with the invention of transistor it replaced the unwieldy vacuum tube as result it led to shrinking the size of electronic machinery. The transistor was applied
          into a computer by 1956 with the combined the advance to the core memory in resulted that computer is more smaller, faster, reliable and energy-efficient predecessors.
          The first scale machine to take advantage to the transistor instead of the difficult machine language. Atomic energy could handle  enormous amounts of data and it is costly
          and too powerful for a business sector need and there is only two LARC's that was installed. Throughout the year there were numbers of successful computers it is use to do business,
          things in universities and in the government and it was the most large firms processed information using computer.The invention of the first generation and second generation of computer
          were the beginning of  the software industry and the birth of a wide new type of careers.
      </p>
      <p>Third Generation is one of the most important in the development in computer hardware in the late 1960s and the early of 1970s. The invention was the integrated circuit it is  a solid-state
          device containing hundreds of transistors and on the tiny silicon chip. It produce large-scale of computer mainframes or higher speed, capacity, and significantly lower costs another type of
          computer at that time was minicomputer it profited in microelectronics and it is smaller than a mainframe for instance, power to control the instruments of scientific laboratory that allow the
          machine to run different programs with central program that monitor and coordinated the memory.
      </p>
      <p>The microprocessors was build in the fourth generation computer as a to thousands of integrated circuits were built into a single silicon chip. In the first generation to filled the whole room
          and the Intel 4004 chip was made in 1971 and all the components of a computer is on a single chip. As the smaller the computer the more powerful and they could be linked to form network and
          develop Internet. The fourth generation computer saw the GUIs, mouse and handheld devices develop.Fifth generation devices is based on artificial intelligence and is still in development, such
          as the voice recognition, the use of parallel processing and superconductors.The goal of the fifth generation is that to input the capable of learning and self-organization.
      </p>
      <p>Since the 1970s there was a lot of growing in the use of computer programming in companies to design and produce and business functions through the use of computer. The CAD/CAM technology is used
          in the computer systems to design and produce was made, CAD (computer-aided design)  to assist creation, modification, analysis and optimization and CAM (computer-aided manufacturing) help to plan,
          control and manage the productions. To make more comprehensive use of the computer the CIM (computer-integrated manufacturing) systems that can handle the cost of accounting and customer bill.

    <h2>Overall In The Computer History</h2>
    <p>
       Computer been in people life and the computer keep on growing and growing. In the past there were no cpmputer and it change when people discover by making some invention that help people with hard math
        or transportation. People been changing computer and technology in the future. The technology become reality and it is combined with speech technologyand have a meaningful dialogue.
